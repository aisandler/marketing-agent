## How to Use in Content Creation

### Step 1: Identify the Angle
What competitive advantage does this content highlight?
- Service culture? → Relevant win theme
- Expertise? → Relevant win theme
- Modern approach? → Relevant win theme

### Step 2: Write the Competitive Insight
Format:
```
WIN THEME [#]: [Theme Name]
"[Key quote or concept from content]"

[Why this matters competitively - 1-2 sentences]
```

### Step 3: Example
**Post topic:** "Every Project Gets Our Full Attention"
**Competitive Insight:**
```
WIN THEME 3: Genuine Attention
"When a client comes to us, that's their project. Their reputation."

This reinforces our relationship-focused approach vs. volume operations.
