---

## Series Naming Patterns

### Consistent Prefix Approach

**Format:** [Newsletter Name] + [Issue identifier] + [Optional hook]

**Examples:**
- "The Weekly Brief #47"
- "Marketing Roundup | Issue 23"
- "[Newsletter Name] - December 12"

**Pros:**
- High recognition
- Builds brand
- Easy to implement

**Cons:**
- Can feel repetitive
- Less curiosity-driving
- Relies on brand strength

**Best for:** Established newsletters with loyal audiences

---

### Date-Based Approach

**Format:** [Timeframe] in [Topic]: [Date range or issue date]

**Examples:**
- "This Week in AI: Dec 9-15"
- "Marketing News - Week of December 12"
- "December Marketing Digest"

**Pros:**
- Clear and informative
- Good for news/digest formats
- Sets expectations

**Cons:**
- Generic feeling
- Low curiosity factor
- Date alone isn't compelling

**Best for:** News digests, industry roundups

---

### Hybrid Approach

**Format:** [Newsletter Name]: [Specific hook for this issue]

**Examples:**
- "The Growth Newsletter: The pricing mistake everyone makes"
- "Marketing Weekly: Why your email list isn't growing"
- "Tech Digest: Apple's surprise announcement"

**Pros:**
- Best of both worlds
- Recognition + curiosity
- Highly flexible

**Cons:**
- Requires crafting unique hooks
- More effort per issue
- Hook must deliver

**Best for:** Most newsletters - recommended default

---

### Pure Curiosity Approach

**Format:** [Standalone compelling subject line]

**Examples:**

- "The metric nobody's tracking"
- "What I learned from 1,000 emails"

**Pros:**
- Maximum curiosity
- Fresh every issue
- No format fatigue

**Cons:**

## Avoiding Subject Line Fatigue

### Rotation Strategies

**Rotate subject line types:**
```
Week 1: Curiosity hook

(Repeat)
```

**Rotate emphasis:**
```
Issue 1: Lead with feature article
Issue 2: Lead with curated content
Issue 3: Lead with data/stat
Issue 4: Lead with reader question
```

### What Causes Fatigue

- Starting with same word repeatedly

**Same structure:**
- "[Number] things about [topic]" every time
- Always a question
- Always the same length

**Same energy:**
- Always urgent
- Always casual
- Never varying tone

### Freshness Techniques

1. **Vary your sentence structure**
   - Statement vs. question vs. fragment
   - Long vs. short
   - With vs. without punctuation marks

2. **Change your hook type**
   - Curiosity gap
   - Specific benefit
   - Social proof
   - Timely relevance
   - Personal angle

3. **Surprise periodically**
   - Unexpected format
   - Different tone
   - Special issue framing
