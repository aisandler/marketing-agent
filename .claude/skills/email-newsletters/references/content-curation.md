# Content Curation for Newsletters

Workflows and frameworks for sourcing, selecting, and organizing newsletter content.

## Curation Philosophy

Great curation is:
- **Selective**: Not everything, just the best
- **Opinionated**: Your perspective adds value
- **Consistent**: Reliable quality every issue
- **Generous**: Credit sources, share widely

Your role as curator: Be the trusted filter your audience doesn't have time to be themselves.

## Sourcing Workflows

### Building Your Source Pipeline

#### Primary Sources (Check Daily/Weekly)
- Industry publications and blogs
- Key influencers and thought leaders
- Research firms and academic sources
- Company blogs of industry leaders
- Newsletters you subscribe to

#### Secondary Sources (Check Periodically)
- Social media feeds (Twitter lists, LinkedIn)
- Reddit and community forums
- Podcast episodes
- YouTube channels
- Conference talks and presentations

#### Discovery Sources (For Fresh Finds)
- Newsletter recommendation platforms
- "Best of" roundups from others
- Reader submissions
- Niche communities
- International/non-English sources (translated)

### Efficient Source Management

**RSS setup:**
```
1. Set up Feedly, Inoreader, or similar
2. Create folders by topic/category
3. Review feeds in batches
4. Star/save potential items
```

**Social listening:**
```
1. Create Twitter lists for key voices
2. Set up LinkedIn notifications for specific people
3. Use Pocket/Instapaper for quick saves
4. Review saved items during curation time
```

**Time-blocking:**
```
- Daily: 15-20 min scanning primary sources
- Weekly: 1-2 hours deep review and selection
- Monthly: 30 min source pipeline review
```

## Selection Framework

### The VALE Criteria

### Quantity Guidelines

| Newsletter Type | Ideal Item Count | Notes |
|-----------------|------------------|-------|
| Digest/Roundup | 8-15 items | More items, less commentary |
| Editorial + Curated | 3-5 items | Fewer items, more commentary |
| Company + Curated | 3-4 items | Supplement to main content |
| Full Hybrid | 5-8 items | Balanced across sections |

### Diversity Checklist

Each issue should aim for:
- [ ] Mix of content formats (articles, videos, tools, etc.)
- [ ] Multiple distinct sources (not same 3 publications)
- [ ] Range of perspectives (not just one viewpoint)
- [ ] Balance of tactical and strategic

- "I don't agree with everything here, but the point about [X] is spot-on"
- Best for: Thought-provoking pieces, controversial takes

**Connection**: Link to other items or past content
- "This builds on [previous item/issue] and adds [new dimension]"
- Best for: Building narrative across issues

**Personal**: Share your experience

### Commentary Length Guidelines

## Content Calendar Integration

### Planning Ahead

**Thematic planning:**
- Plan themes 2-4 weeks out
- Align with industry events, seasons
- Leave room for breaking news
- Create content buckets to fill

**Example planning calendar:**
```
Week 1: [Theme] - Focus on [topic]
Week 2: [Theme] - Focus on [topic]
Week 3: Open/flexible
Week 4: [Theme] - Focus on [topic]
```

### Handling Content Gaps

**When content is thin:**
- Go deeper on fewer items
- Include evergreen favorites
- Feature reader submissions
- Write more original commentary
- Revisit older content with new perspective

**When content is abundant:**
- Be more selective, not more inclusive
- Save quality items for future issues
- Create a "best of" bonus section
- Consider special topic issues

---

## Reader Input and Feedback

### Encouraging Submissions

**Direct ask:**
- "See something great? Reply with your recommendations."
- "What did I miss? Hit reply."

**Structured submission:**
- Create a simple form for reader submissions
- Ask for: Link, why it's worth sharing, brief description

**Incentive:**
- Credit readers who submit featured items
- Consider small rewards for regular contributors

### Using Reader Feedback

**Track patterns:**
- What topics get the most clicks?
- What generates replies?
- What gets shared?

**Adjust accordingly:**
- More of what works
- Less of what doesn't
- Test new areas based on requests

## Quality Control Checklist

Before including any item:

- [ ] I've actually read/watched/listened to this
- [ ] It meets my VALE criteria
- [ ] It's appropriate for my audience

- [ ] I've properly attributed the source
- [ ] The link works

## Common Curation Mistakes

### Quantity Padding
Including mediocre content to hit a number. Less quality > more quantity.

### Source Laziness
Always curating from the same 5 sources. Diversify your pipeline.

### No Added Value
Just linking without commentary. Your perspective is the product.

### Recency Bias
Only including what came out this week. Great content doesn't expire.

### Ignoring Format Variety
All articles, no videos/podcasts/tools. Mix it up.

### Not Reading What You Recommend
Sharing based on headline alone. Actually consume the content.

### Missing Attribution
Not crediting sources properly. Always cite.
