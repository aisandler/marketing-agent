- "Friday Five: [Topic]"
- "[Newsletter Name] Weekly #[Number]"
- "[Topic] Digest - [Date]"

---

## Curation Best Practices

### Source Diversification
- Don't rely on the same 5 sources every issue
- Mix well-known and emerging voices
- Include different formats (written, audio, video)
- Consider non-obvious sources (academic, international, adjacent fields)

### Adding Value Beyond Links
Your curation should answer: "Why should I click this?"
- Context: Why this matters now
- Summary: What you'll learn
- Opinion: Your take on the content
- Connection: How it relates to other items or past content

### Quality Control
- Actually read/watch what you recommend
- Don't pad with filler to hit a number
- It's okay to have a shorter issue if content is thin
- Remove items that don't meet your standard

### Credit and Attribution
- Always cite original source
- Link to original, not aggregator copies
- Note if something is paywalled
- Give credit to whoever surfaced the content

---

## Key Metrics

Track these to measure digest newsletter effectiveness:

- **Open rate**: Consistent openers indicate habit formation
- **Click-through rate**: Higher than original content newsletters typically
- **Click distribution**: Which sections/items get engagement
- **Subscriber retention**: Digests should have low churn
- **Reply rate**: Responses indicate engaged readers
- **Growth rate**: Good digests grow through referrals

### Section-level tracking
- Track clicks by section to optimize structure
- Identify which content types perform best
- Notice patterns (listicles vs. long-reads, etc.)

---

## Common Pitfalls

### Quantity Over Quality
10 mediocre links dilute the 3 great ones. Less is more.

### No Curatorial Voice
Just listing links isn't valuable. Your commentary is the product.

### Stale Content
Weekly roundups with month-old content feel lazy. Stay current.

### Clickbait Descriptions
If the content doesn't deliver what you promised, trust erodes.

### Missing Attribution
Not crediting sources damages your reputation and relationships.

### Inconsistent Delivery
Digest readers build habits. Missing days breaks the pattern.

### All The Same Sources
If you're just summarizing the same 5 publications, why subscribe?
