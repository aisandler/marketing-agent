## Subject Line Strategies

### Approaches for Company Updates

**What's new:**
- "[Product] Update: [Key Feature] is here"
- "New in [Product]: [Feature]"
- "[Month] Product Update: [Number] new things"

**Benefit-focused:**
- "Now you can [do thing] in [Product]"
- "We fixed [common pain point]"
- "Announcing [Feature] - [key benefit]"

**Version/release:**
- "[Product] v[Number]: What's new"
- "[Season/Month] Release Notes"

**Casual/brand voice:**
- "We've been busy... here's what's new"
- "Fresh from the [Product] team"

### Series naming
- Date-based: "[Product] Update - December 2024"
- Version-based: "[Product] v2.5 Release Notes"
- Numbered: "[Product] Newsletter #24"

---

## Key Metrics

Track these to measure company newsletter effectiveness:

- **Open rate**: Should be higher than marketing emails (30%+ target)
- **Feature adoption**: Did announced features see usage increase?
- **Click-through to documentation**: Interest in learning more
- **Support ticket reduction**: Did proactive communication help?
- **Unsubscribe rate**: Very low tolerance (under 0.2%)
- **Forward rate**: Product updates often get shared internally

---

## Common Pitfalls

### Announcing Everything
Not every bug fix needs a newsletter mention. Focus on what users care about.

### Feature-Speak Without Benefit
"Added X functionality" means nothing. "Now you can do Y" matters.

### Inconsistent Schedule
If you say monthly, deliver monthly. Skipping builds doubt.

### All Product, No Personality
Company updates can still have voice and warmth.

### Missing the Why
Don't just say what changed - explain why it matters to users.

### No Clear Actions
Every update should connect to something users can do or try.

## B2B vs B2C Adaptations

| Aspect | B2B Company Updates | B2C Company Updates |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Tone | Professional, efficient | Friendly, enthusiastic |
| Detail level | More technical, comprehensive | Simpler, benefit-focused |
| Customer spotlight | Company name, ROI metrics | Individual stories, reviews |
| What's coming | Roadmap previews, beta access | Teasers, excitement building |
| Frequency | Monthly or quarterly | Monthly or bi-weekly |
| Length | Can be longer, more detailed | Shorter, scannable |

---

## Segmentation Opportunities

Company updates benefit greatly from segmentation:

- **By plan/tier**: Show relevant features per plan
- **By usage pattern**: Highlight features they'll actually use
- **By tenure**: New users vs. power users need different depth
- **By role**: Admins vs. end users care about different things
- **By engagement**: Active users vs. at-risk users need different messaging
