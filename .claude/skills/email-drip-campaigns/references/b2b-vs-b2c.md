## B2B Adaptations

### Tone and Voice
- **Professional but not stiff**: Authority without being boring
- **Peer-to-peer**: Write as an equal, not as a vendor
- **ROI-focused**: Connect everything to business outcomes
- **Credibility-driven**: Use data, research, and proof points

**Example tone shift:**
- B2C: "You'll love how easy this is!"
- B2B: "Teams typically see a 40% reduction in manual work within the first month."

### Sequence Structure
B2B sequences are typically **longer** with **more spacing**:

**Standard B2B Nurture Timeline:**
- Email 1: Day 0 (immediate)
- Email 2: Day 3
- Email 3: Day 7
- Email 4: Day 10
- Email 5: Day 14
- Email 6: Day 18
- Email 7: Day 23
- Email 8: Day 28

**Why longer gaps:**
- Buyers are busy professionals
- Decisions involve research and stakeholders
- Too frequent = perceived as spam
- Content needs time to digest

### Content Focus

**Lead with education:**
- Industry insights and trends
- Best practices and frameworks
- Research and data
- Expert perspectives

**Build credibility through:**
- Case studies with metrics
- Customer logos and testimonials
- Third-party validation (awards, reviews, analysts)
- Thought leadership content

**Address the buying committee:**
- Content for end users (features, daily impact)
- Content for decision-makers (ROI, strategic value)
- Content for technical evaluators (security, integration)

### CTAs

**Appropriate B2B CTAs:**
- Book a demo / Schedule a call
- Download the whitepaper / Get the guide
- Watch the webinar / See it in action
- Start your free trial
- Request a proposal / Get pricing
- Talk to sales

**CTA progression:**
1. Low commitment: Read article, watch video
2. Medium commitment: Download gated content
3. High commitment: Book time with sales

### Subject Lines

**B2B subject line approaches:**
- **Specific value**: "Reduce invoice processing time by 3 hours/week"
- **Question format**: "Is manual data entry costing you $50k/year?"
- **Peer curiosity**: "How [Similar Company] cut churn by 30%"
- **Resource offer**: "[Free Guide] 2024 State of [Industry]"
- **Problem recognition**: "The hidden cost of disconnected tools"

**Avoid in B2B:**
- Excessive urgency or FOMO
- Clickbait or vague promises
- Emojis (use sparingly if at all)
- ALL CAPS

### Personalization

**B2B personalization data to use:**
- Company name and industry
- Contact's role/title
- Company size
- Use case or pain point expressed
- Content they've engaged with
- Stage in evaluation process

**Example personalized opening:**
> "Hi {First_name}, I noticed {Company} has been exploring ways to improve {pain_point_area}. Many {Industry} teams face similar challenges..."

## B2C Adaptations

### Tone and Voice
- **Conversational and warm**: Talk like a helpful friend
- **Emotionally resonant**: Connect to feelings, not just logic
- **Benefits-focused**: What's in it for them personally
- **Personality-driven**: Brand voice can shine through

**Example tone shift:**
- B2B: "Our solution reduces operational overhead by 25%."
- B2C: "Imagine having 3 extra hours every week to spend how you want."

### Sequence Structure
B2C sequences are typically **shorter** with **tighter timing**:

**Standard B2C Welcome Timeline:**
- Email 1: Immediate (welcome)
- Email 2: Day 1
- Email 3: Day 3
- Email 4: Day 5
- Email 5: Day 7

**Why faster cadence:**
- Consumer attention is fleeting
- Decisions are often quicker
- Emotional momentum matters
- Competition for inbox space is fierce

### Content Focus

**Lead with benefits and transformation:**
- How their life will be better
- Before/after scenarios
- Emotional payoffs
- Lifestyle imagery

**Build trust through:**
- Customer reviews and ratings
- Social proof (X people bought this)
- User-generated content
- Influencer or celebrity endorsements
- Money-back guarantees

**Create urgency (authentically):**
- Limited-time offers
- Low stock alerts (if real)
- Seasonal relevance
- Exclusive access

### CTAs

**Appropriate B2C CTAs:**
- Shop now / Buy today
- Claim your discount
- Start your free trial
- Join now / Sign up free
- Get started
- Add to cart
- Unlock your offer

**CTA characteristics:**
- Action-oriented verbs
- Clear benefit implied
- Urgency when appropriate
- Single, prominent button

### Subject Lines

**B2C subject line approaches:**
- **Curiosity**: "The one thing everyone gets wrong about..."
- **Benefit-driven**: "Wake up with perfect skin (finally)"
- **FOMO**: "Last chance: 40% off ends tonight"
- **Personal**: "We picked these just for you, {First_name}"
- **Emoji-enhanced**: "Your weekend plans just got better"
- **Question**: "Still thinking about it?"

**B2C can get away with:**
- More emojis (but don't overdo it)
- Urgency and scarcity
- Playful language
- Shorter, punchier copy
- Casual abbreviations

### Personalization

**B2C personalization data to use:**
- First name
- Past purchase history
- Browsing behavior
- Location
- Birthday/anniversary
- Preferences stated
- Loyalty status

**Example personalized content:**
> "Since you loved the [Previous Purchase], we thought you'd want first look at our new [Related Product]..."

## Hybrid Considerations

Some businesses don't fit neatly into B2B or B2C:

### B2B2C (Selling to businesses that serve consumers)
- Professional tone in sequence
- Include content about their end customers
- ROI = helping them serve customers better

### SMB (Small business owners)
- More personal than enterprise B2B
- Business owners often decide quickly
- Mix of emotional and rational appeals
- They are the user AND the buyer

### Prosumer / Creator Economy
- Professional tools, individual buyers
- Passion and craft appeal
- Community and peer proof matter
- Blend B2C urgency with B2B education

### High-Consideration B2C (Real estate, education, finance)
- Consumer audience, but longer cycles
- More education needed
- Trust-building important
- Closer to B2B pacing
