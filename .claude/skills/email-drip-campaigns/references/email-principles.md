# Email Drip Campaign Principles

Core principles for creating effective email sequences that convert.

## Strategic Principles

### One Goal Per Email
Each email should have a single primary call-to-action. Multiple CTAs compete for attention and dilute conversion. If you need to communicate multiple things, split into separate emails.

### Progressive Commitment
Start with small, low-friction asks and escalate over time:
- Email 1-2: Read content, click a link
- Email 3-4: Download a resource, watch a video
- Email 5+: Book a demo, start a trial, make a purchase

People who take small actions are more likely to take bigger ones later.

### Value Before Ask
Every email should deliver value before requesting action. The ratio should be approximately:
- **70% value** (education, insights, entertainment)
- **30% ask** (CTA, promotion, request)

Earn the right to sell by being genuinely helpful first.

### Relevance Over Volume
Fewer, targeted emails outperform many generic ones. A 5-email sequence tailored to the recipient's situation beats a 15-email generic blast.

### Exit Gracefully
- Always include unsubscribe options
- Sunset inactive contacts after reasonable attempts
- A clean list with engaged subscribers is more valuable than a large list of non-openers

## Content Principles

### Subject Line is 80% of Success
The subject line determines whether your email gets opened. Invest heavily here:
- **Be specific**: "3 ways to reduce churn by 20%" beats "Tips for retention"
- **Create curiosity**: Open a loop that the email body closes
- **Match the content**: Never clickbait - trust erodes fast
- **Test constantly**: A/B test subject lines on every send

### Preview Text Matters
The preview text (preheader) is prime real estate. Use it to:
- **Extend** the subject line, not repeat it
- Add context that increases open rates
- Avoid default text like "View in browser" or "Having trouble viewing?"

### Scannable Format
Most readers scan, not read. Structure for scanning:
- **Short paragraphs**: 2-3 sentences max
- **Bullet points**: For lists of benefits or features
- **Bold key phrases**: Guide the eye to important points
- **Clear hierarchy**: Headers, subheaders, body text
- **White space**: Let the content breathe

### Personalization Beyond Name
Using `{first_name}` is table stakes. Deeper personalization includes:
- **Behavioral**: Based on actions (pages visited, features used)
- **Contextual**: Based on segment (industry, company size, role)
- **Temporal**: Based on timing (how long since signup, purchase)
- **Dynamic content**: Different blocks for different segments

### Mobile First
60%+ of emails are opened on mobile. Design accordingly:
- Single-column layouts
- Large tap targets for buttons (44px minimum)
- Readable font sizes (16px+ for body)
- Images that scale or hide on mobile
- Short subject lines (30-40 characters visible on mobile)

## Timing Principles

### Trigger-Based Beats Calendar-Based
Event-triggered emails consistently outperform scheduled sends:
- **Behavioral triggers**: Signed up, abandoned cart, used feature
- **Milestone triggers**: 7 days since signup, first purchase anniversary
- **Engagement triggers**: Opened last 3 emails, clicked specific link

### Respect Frequency
Email fatigue is real. General guidelines:
- **Onboarding**: Can be daily for first week, then taper
- **Nurture**: 1-2 emails per week maximum
- **Sales**: 2-3 per week during active sequence
- **Re-engagement**: Space emails 3-5 days apart

### Sequence Breathing Room
Allow recipients time to read and digest:
- Don't send the next email until 24-48 hours minimum
- Consider engagement signals (if they didn't open #2, wait longer for #3)
- End sequences definitively - don't leave people in limbo

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Generic Subject Lines
Avoid vague subjects that could apply to any email:
- "Newsletter" / "Update" / "News"
- "Check this out"
- "Don't miss this"

Instead: Be specific about what's inside.

### Wall of Text
Long, unbroken paragraphs kill engagement. If your email looks like an essay, rewrite it:
- Break into shorter paragraphs
- Add bullet points
- Use subheaders
- Cut 50% of the words

### Multiple Competing CTAs
When everything is a priority, nothing is:
- Choose ONE primary CTA per email
- Secondary links can exist but should be visually de-emphasized
- Buttons should be for the main action only

### Over-Automation
Automated doesn't mean robotic. Avoid:
- Generic language that feels templated
- Ignoring behavioral signals (sending sale emails to recent purchasers)
- Never pausing for human review or override

### Clickbait Disconnect
Subject lines that don't match content destroy trust:
- If you promise "the secret to..." deliver an actual insight
- If you say "urgent" it better actually be time-sensitive
- Overpromising leads to unsubscribes

### Ignoring Mobile
Emails that break on mobile kill conversions:
- Multi-column layouts that stack poorly
- Tiny buttons impossible to tap
- Images that don't scale
- Text that requires zooming

## Metrics That Matter

### Primary Metrics
- **Open rate**: Subject line effectiveness (industry avg: 15-25%)
- **Click-through rate**: Content relevance (industry avg: 2-5%)
- **Conversion rate**: CTA effectiveness (varies by goal)
- **Unsubscribe rate**: List health (should be < 0.5% per send)

### Secondary Metrics
- **Reply rate**: Engagement depth (especially for sales sequences)
- **Forward rate**: Content share-worthiness
- **Revenue per email**: Bottom-line impact
- **Sequence completion rate**: How many finish vs drop off

### Warning Signs
- Open rates dropping over sequence
- High unsubscribes on specific emails
- Clicks but no conversions
- Spam complaints increasing
