## Common Pitfalls

### All Pitch, No Value
Every email should give something, not just ask for something.

### Too Generic
Use what you know about them (company, industry, behavior).

### Ignoring Signals
If they click but don't reply, try a different approach. If they reply, have a human follow up.

### Weak CTAs
Be specific: "Book a 15-minute call Thursday" beats "Let me know if interested."

### No Urgency
Without a reason to act now, deals stall. Create authentic urgency.

### Giving Up Too Early
Most sales happen after 5+ touches. Persist (politely).

## Sequence Extensions

### After No Response (Add 2-3 emails):
- "Bump" email: Short, simple "did you see this?"
- Breakup email: "Closing your file" with one last ask
- Value-add: Relevant article or insight with soft CTA

### After Objection:
- Specific response to their stated concern
- Additional proof point addressing that objection
- Alternative offer or approach

### After Demo/Call (New sequence):
- Thank you + recap
- Additional resources
- Proposal/pricing follow-up
- Decision timeline check-in
