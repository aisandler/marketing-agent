## Key Metrics

Track these to measure onboarding effectiveness:

- **Activation rate**: % completing key onboarding action
- **Time to first value**: How quickly they get first win
- **Setup completion rate**: % completing all setup steps
- **Email engagement**: Open/click rates by email
- **Drop-off points**: Where people stop engaging
- **Day 7/14/30 retention**: Who sticks around

## Common Pitfalls

### Too Much Too Fast
Don't overwhelm with every feature. Focus on the critical path.

### No Clear First Win
If users can't get value in email 1-2, they may never return.

### Generic vs. Personalized
Use behavioral data to adjust sequence (skip setup email if already done).

### Ignoring Non-Engagers
If someone doesn't open emails 1-3, consider a rescue sequence.

### Ending Abruptly
Onboarding should transition smoothly to ongoing engagement or nurture.
