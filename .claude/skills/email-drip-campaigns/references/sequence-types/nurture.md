- Allow weekends to pass

- Space emails 2-3 days apart
- Full sequence: 2-3 weeks
- Can send any day

### High-Value B2B (Enterprise)
- Space emails 5-7 days apart
- Full sequence: 6-10 weeks
- More content, slower pace

---

## Key Metrics

- **Engagement progression**: Are open/click rates staying steady?
- **Content consumption**: What topics drive most engagement?
- **Reply rate**: Are people engaging in conversation?
- **Sequence completion**: What % reach the final email?
- **Conversion rate**: What % convert from nurture?
- **Time to conversion**: How long from email 1 to purchase?

---

## Common Pitfalls

### Selling Too Early
Wait until email 7-8 for any product mention. Build trust first.

### Generic Content
Personalize based on lead source, behavior, or stated interests.

### No Clear Through-Line
Each email should build on the last. Tell a coherent story.

### Ignoring Engagement Signals
If they click every email, accelerate. If they go cold, change approach.

### Weak Transitions
End each email with a tease for the next. Keep them curious.
