# Re-engagement Email Sequences

Patterns and guidance for win-back campaigns that reactivate inactive users or customers.

## Purpose

Re-engagement sequences help:
- Reactivate dormant users before they fully churn
- Win back lapsed customers
- Clean email lists of truly disengaged contacts
- Recover revenue at low acquisition cost

## When to Trigger

Common re-engagement triggers:
- No login for 30/60/90 days
- No purchase in X months
- No email opens for 3+ campaigns
- Subscription about to expire
- Trial ended without conversion

## Sequence Structure

### Standard Re-engagement (3-5 emails)

| Email | Theme | Timing | Goal |
|-------|-------|--------|------|
| 1 | We Miss You + What's New | Day 0 | Remind value, show improvements |
| 2 | Special Comeback Offer | Day 3-4 | Incentivize return |
| 3 | Social Proof / FOMO | Day 7-8 | Show what they're missing |
| 4 | Last Chance | Day 12-14 | Final attempt with urgency |
| 5 | Goodbye / Sunset | Day 20+ | Clean exit, list hygiene |

## Email Templates

### Email 1: We Miss You + What's New

**Purpose**: Remind them of value and show the product has evolved.

**Key elements:**
- Acknowledge the absence without guilt-tripping
- Highlight new features or improvements
- Make return easy with clear link
- Friendly, not desperate tone

**Subject line approaches:**
- "It's been a while, {First_name}"
- "Things have changed since you left"
- "We've made some improvements you'll love"
- "Your account is waiting for you"

**Structure:**
```
1. Friendly acknowledgment of absence (1 sentence)
2. "Since you've been gone, we've added..."
3. 2-3 key improvements or new features
4. Why these changes matter for them
5. Easy link to come back and explore
```

**CTA**: "See what's new" or "Log back in"

**Tone tip**: Be warm and welcoming, not accusatory. "We miss you" not "Why did you leave?"

**Purpose**: Show what they're missing.

**Key elements:**

- New content, features, or products
- Create healthy FOMO

**Subject line approaches:**
- "Here's what you've been missing"
- "While you were away..."

- "Your friends are still loving [Product]"

**Structure:**
```
1. "Our community has been busy"
2. Stats or highlights of activity
3. Success stories or testimonials (brief)
4. New stuff they haven't experienced
5. "There's still a spot for you"
```

**CTA**: "Rejoin the community" or "See what's new"

**B2B**: Industry peers using successfully, new integrations, ecosystem growth

### Email 4: Last Chance

**Purpose**: Final push before accepting disengagement.

**Key elements:**
- Clear "last email" framing
- Recap of offer or value
- Direct question about their interest
- Easy yes or no response

**Subject line approaches:**

- "One more thing before we go"

**Structure:**
```
1. "I've tried reaching out a few times..."
2. Quick recap of what we've offered
3. Direct question: "Is [Product] still of interest?"
4. Make it easy to say yes OR no
5. If yes: clear action. If no: respect their choice.
```

**CTA**: "Yes, I'm interested" or "Keep my account active"

**Alternative CTA**: "Unsubscribe me" (cleaning is healthy)

### Email 5: Goodbye / Sunset

**Purpose**: Graceful exit and list cleaning.

**Key elements:**
- Accept they're not coming back (for now)
- Leave door open for future
- Give them control (stay subscribed or not)
- List hygiene maintenance

**Subject line approaches:**
- "Goodbye (for now)"
- "Removing your account from our list"
- "We'll miss you"
- "The door is always open"

**Structure:**
```
1. "Since we haven't heard back..."
2. We're going to stop sending these emails
3. What happens to their account (if applicable)
4. "If you ever want to come back..."
5. How to stay subscribed if they change their mind
```

**CTA**: "Wait, keep me subscribed!" (one last chance)

**Why this email matters**: Sending to truly disengaged contacts hurts deliverability. Better to confirm unsubscribe than keep sending to the void.

## Segmentation Tips

Re-engagement works better when segmented:

### By Engagement Level
- **Warm**: Opened email recently but didn't act → lighter touch
- **Cold**: No opens in 30+ days → more aggressive incentive
- **Ice cold**: No opens in 90+ days → direct to sunset

### By Customer Value
- **High-value churned**: Personal outreach, high-touch recovery
- **Regular customers**: Standard sequence with good offer
- **Low-value/trial only**: Automated sequence, lower offer

### By Reason for Leaving
- **Price sensitive**: Discount-focused message
- **Feature gaps**: "We built what you asked for" message
- **Support issues**: Apology + improvement message
- **Just forgot**: Simple reminder sequence

## Common Pitfalls

### Too Desperate
Desperation pushes people away. Be confident and welcoming, not needy.

### No Real Incentive
"We miss you" isn't enough. Give them a reason to come back.

### Ignoring Why They Left
If they left due to a problem, acknowledge and address it.

### Never Giving Up
Some people are gone forever. Sunset them for list health.

### Same Message to Everyone
Segment by value, behavior, and churn reason for better results.
