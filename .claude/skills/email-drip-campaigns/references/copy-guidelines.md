# Email Copy Guidelines

Writing guidelines for creating effective email copy that converts.

## Subject Lines

### Principles

**Specificity beats cleverness**: A clear, specific subject outperforms a vague, witty one.
- Good: "3 ways to cut meeting time by 50%"
- Weak: "Time to level up?"

**Length matters**: 30-50 characters optimal. Mobile truncates at ~35 characters.
- Keep critical words front-loaded
- Avoid filler words at the start

**Create curiosity or value**: Open a loop the email closes, or promise clear value.
- Curiosity: "The one thing most marketers get wrong"
- Value: "Your step-by-step guide to [outcome]"

### Subject Line Formulas

**How-to format:**
- "How to [achieve outcome] in [timeframe]"
- "How [Company] [achieved result]"

**Question format:**
- "Are you making this [topic] mistake?"
- "What if you could [desired outcome]?"

**Number format:**
- "[X] ways to [achieve outcome]"
- "[X] mistakes that [cause problem]"

**Curiosity gap:**
- "The [topic] secret nobody talks about"
- "Why [unexpected thing] works better"

**Direct benefit:**
- "[Specific outcome] starts here"
- "Get [benefit] without [pain point]"

**Personal touch:**
- "{First_name}, quick question"
- "Thought of you when I saw this"

### Subject Line A/B Testing

Always create 2-3 variants to test:
- **Variant A**: Different angle (curiosity vs. benefit)
- **Variant B**: Different format (question vs. statement)
- **Variant C**: Different length (short vs. detailed)

Test one variable at a time to learn what works.

## Preview Text (Preheader)

### Purpose
The preview text appears next to or below the subject line in inbox. Use it to:
- Extend the subject (add more context)
- Create urgency or curiosity
- Include details that didn't fit in subject

### Best Practices

**Complement, don't repeat**: The preview should add new information.
- Subject: "Your guide is ready"
- Preview: "5 proven strategies inside + bonus template"

**Front-load the message**: First 40-60 characters are most visible.

**Avoid default text**: Don't let "View in browser" or "Unsubscribe" show.

### Preview Text Formula

`[Extension of subject] + [benefit or curiosity hook]`

Examples:
- Subject: "Quick question about your marketing"
- Preview: "Plus a resource that might help with Q1 planning"

## Email Body Structure

### The Inverted Pyramid

Put the most important content first:

```
[HOOK] - Grab attention immediately
[VALUE] - Deliver the core message
[SUPPORT] - Evidence, examples, details
[CTA] - Clear next step
```

### Opening Lines

The first line determines if they keep reading. Options:

**Direct relevance:**
"If you're struggling with [problem], this email is for you."

**Question hook:**
"What would it mean for your business if you could [outcome]?"

**Story hook:**
"Last week, I talked to a [role] who was dealing with [problem]..."

**Surprising fact:**
"Did you know that [surprising statistic about their situation]?"

**Personal connection:**
"I noticed you [action they took], so I thought you'd find this useful..."

### Body Paragraphs

**Keep paragraphs short**: 2-3 sentences maximum. Single sentences are fine.

**Use white space**: Let the email breathe. Dense text kills engagement.

**One idea per paragraph**: Don't cram multiple points together.

**Use bullets for lists**: Easier to scan than inline lists.

### Closing

End with momentum toward the CTA:

**Bridge to action:**
"Here's how to get started..."
"If you're ready to [outcome]..."
"The next step is simple..."

**Reduce friction:**
"It only takes 2 minutes..."
"No commitment required..."
"You can cancel anytime..."

## Calls to Action (CTAs)

### CTA Principles

**One primary CTA per email**: Multiple buttons dilute conversion.

**Action-oriented verbs**: Start with what they'll do.
- "Start your free trial" not "Free trial available"
- "Book your demo" not "Demo information"

**Specificity**: Be clear about what happens when they click.
- "Schedule a 15-minute call" not "Get in touch"
- "Download the PDF guide" not "Learn more"

### Button vs. Text Link

**Use buttons for:**
- Primary CTA
- Key conversion action
- Mobile-friendly clicking

**Use text links for:**
- Secondary actions
- Within body copy
- Multiple related resources

### CTA Examples by Campaign Type

**Onboarding:**
- "Complete your setup"
- "Try [feature] now"
- "See your dashboard"

**Nurture:**
- "Read the full guide"
- "Watch the case study"
- "Get the free template"

**Sales:**
- "Book your demo"
- "Start free trial"
- "Get your quote"

**Re-engagement:**
- "Claim your offer"
- "See what's new"
- "Reactivate my account"

## Personalization

### Basic Personalization

**First name**: Use `{First_name}` in subject lines and opening.
- Include fallback: `{First_name|there}`

**Company name**: For B2B, reference their company.
- "How {Company} can reduce churn..."

### Advanced Personalization

**Behavioral:**
- Reference pages they visited
- Mention features they used
- Acknowledge content they downloaded

**Contextual:**
- Industry-specific language
- Role-specific concerns
- Company size considerations

**Temporal:**
- Time since signup
- Anniversary or milestone
- Seasonal relevance

### Personalization Examples

**Generic:**
"Hi there, check out our new features."

**Basic personalized:**
"Hi Sarah, check out our new features."

**Deeply personalized:**
"Hi Sarah, since you've been using our reporting dashboard heavily, you'll love our new scheduled exports feature."

## Tone and Voice

### Voice Consistency

Maintain consistent voice throughout the sequence:

**Define your spectrum:**
- Formal ← → Casual
- Serious ← → Playful
- Expert ← → Peer
- Reserved ← → Enthusiastic

**B2B default**: Professional-peer, informative, confident
**B2C default**: Friendly-casual, benefit-focused, energetic

### Writing Tips

**Write like a person, not a company:**
- "I wanted to share..." not "We are pleased to announce..."
- "You'll love..." not "Customers report satisfaction with..."

**Use "you" more than "we":**
- Focus on their outcomes, not your features
- Bad: "We built this feature to..."
- Good: "You can now..."

**Avoid jargon unless your audience uses it:**
- Match their vocabulary
- Simple words beat impressive ones

**Read it aloud:**
- If it sounds stiff, rewrite
- Conversation tone = higher engagement

## Formatting

### Visual Hierarchy

Guide the eye through the email:

1. **Subject line** → Grab attention
2. **Preview text** → Extend curiosity
3. **Opening line** → Hook them in
4. **Subheaders** → Allow scanning
5. **Key points** → Bolded or bulleted
6. **CTA button** → Clear and prominent

### Emphasis Techniques

**Bold**: For key phrases readers should notice while scanning
**Bullets**: For lists of features, benefits, or steps
**Numbers**: For sequences or countdowns
**Short paragraphs**: For easier reading

### What to Avoid

- ALL CAPS (feels like shouting)
- Excessive punctuation!!!
- Too many colors or fonts
- Large blocks of text
- Centered body text (hard to read)

## Common Mistakes

### Weak openings
Don't start with "I hope this email finds you well" or "Just following up."
Start with relevance or value.

### Feature dumping
Don't list every feature. Pick 1-3 that matter most to this audience.

### Vague CTAs
"Click here" or "Learn more" don't compel action.
Be specific about what they'll get.

### Too long
If you can say it in 100 words, don't use 300.
Brevity respects their time.

### No mobile optimization
60%+ open on mobile. Keep sentences short, buttons tappable.

### Overselling
Credibility > hype. Specific proof > vague claims.
