# Context Gathering Framework

Questions and process for understanding the business context before creating a drip campaign.

## Gathering Process

### Step 1: Start with Essentials
Ask these questions first - they shape everything else:
1. Campaign type (determines sequence structure)
2. Business type (determines tone and tactics)
3. Industry (determines language and examples)

### Step 2: Understand the Audience
Dig into who receives these emails:
- Target segment and characteristics
- Pain points and challenges
- Objections and hesitations

### Step 3: Define the Goal
Clarify what success looks like:
- Primary conversion action
- Secondary goals
- Success metrics

### Step 4: Capture Voice and Constraints
Understand how to write:
- Brand voice and tone
- Technical constraints
- Existing assets to reference

## Essential Questions

### Campaign Fundamentals

**1. Campaign Type**
> Which type of email sequence do you need?
- **Onboarding**: Welcome new users/customers, drive activation and adoption
- **Nurture**: Educate leads, build trust over time before purchase
- **Re-engagement**: Win back inactive users or lapsed customers
- **Sales**: Move prospects through the buying decision

*This determines the sequence structure and email themes.*

**2. Business Type**
> Is this for a B2B or B2C context?
- **B2B**: Selling to businesses, longer sales cycles, multiple stakeholders
- **B2C**: Selling to consumers, often shorter decisions, individual buyers

*This affects tone, timing, CTAs, and content focus.*

**3. Industry/Vertical**
> What industry or market are you in?

Let the user describe in their own words. Don't provide a dropdown. Use their description to adapt language, examples, and proof points.

*This shapes terminology, examples, and credibility signals.*

### Audience Understanding

**4. Target Segment**
> Who is the primary audience for this campaign?

Understand:
- Job titles or roles (B2B)
- Demographics or personas (B2C)
- Where they are in the customer journey
- What segment or list they belong to

**5. Pain Points**
> What problems does your audience face that you solve?

Get specific. "Save time" is vague. "Reduce manual data entry by 5 hours per week" is specific.

**6. Objections**
> What typically prevents people from buying or converting?

Common objections to address:
- Price concerns
- Timing ("not ready yet")
- Trust ("will this work for me?")
- Complexity ("seems hard to implement")
- Alternatives ("why you vs. competitor?")

**7. Decision Process**
> How do your customers typically make decisions?

B2B considerations:
- Who else is involved? (committee, boss approval)
- What's the typical evaluation timeline?
- What do they need to justify the decision?

B2C considerations:
- Impulse vs. considered purchase?
- Emotional vs. rational drivers?
- Social proof importance?

### Campaign Specifics

**8. Trigger Event**
> What triggers someone entering this sequence?

Examples:
- Signed up for free trial
- Downloaded a lead magnet
- Abandoned shopping cart
- Haven't logged in for 30 days
- Requested a demo

**9. Primary Goal**
> What is the main action you want recipients to take?

Be specific:
- Book a demo call
- Start a paid subscription
- Complete their profile setup
- Make a purchase
- Upgrade to premium

**10. Brand Voice**
> Describe your brand voice and communication style.

Dimensions to clarify:
- **Formal ↔ Casual**: Corporate professional or conversational?
- **Serious ↔ Playful**: Straightforward or personality-driven?
- **Technical ↔ Simple**: Jargon-friendly or plain language?
- **Reserved ↔ Enthusiastic**: Understated or energetic?

Ask for examples of existing communications if available.

### Technical Constraints

**11. Sequence Length**
> How many emails do you want in this sequence?

If unsure, suggest based on campaign type:
- Onboarding: 5-7 emails
- Nurture: 7-12 emails
- Re-engagement: 3-5 emails
- Sales: 5-8 emails

**12. Timing Preferences**
> Any constraints on send timing or frequency?

Consider:
- Minimum gap between emails
- Maximum sequence duration
- Specific send times or days to avoid
- Time zone considerations

**13. Personalization Data**
> What data do you have available for personalization?

Common options:
- First name, company name
- Role/title
- Industry
- Past purchases or behavior
- Feature usage
- Lead source

---

## Optional Context (If Available)

### Competitive Landscape
> Who are your main competitors? What differentiates you?

Useful for:
- Positioning language
- Comparison emails
- Handling "why not competitor?" objections

### Existing Assets
> Do you have existing content to reference or repurpose?

Check for:
- Blog posts
- Case studies
- Testimonials
- Videos or webinars
- Lead magnets

### Past Performance
> What has worked or not worked in previous campaigns?

Learn from:
- High-performing subject lines
- Emails with high unsubscribes
- Content that got replies
- CTAs that converted

## Tips for Gathering Context

### Ask Open-Ended First
Start with open questions, then drill down:
- "Tell me about your audience" → "What's their biggest frustration?"
- "What do you sell?" → "What outcome does it create for customers?"

### Use Their Language
Mirror the terminology they use. If they say "clients" not "customers," use "clients" in the emails.

### Look for Specifics
Vague inputs create generic outputs. Push for specifics:
- "We save time" → "How much time? On what tasks?"
- "Better results" → "What results? How much better?"

### Check for Red Flags
Watch for context that might indicate problems:
- Unrealistic goals ("100% open rates")
- Spammy intent (purchased lists, misleading subjects)
- Missing basics (no clear value proposition)

### Suggest Reasonable Defaults
When users are unsure, offer guidance:
- "For B2B nurture sequences, 8-10 emails over 4-6 weeks is typical"
- "Most brands in your space use a professional but approachable tone"
