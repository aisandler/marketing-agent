## Common Mistakes

### Too Many Fields
Every additional field reduces conversion. Start minimal.

### Weak Value Proposition
"Sign up for our newsletter" doesn't convert. Offer specific value.

### Hidden Form
Form should be visible above the fold, not buried.

### No Preview
Show them what they're getting (cover image, preview pages).

### Missing Credibility
Why should they trust you to deliver value?

### No Urgency
Even lead gen can benefit from authentic urgency (limited seats, bonus expires).
