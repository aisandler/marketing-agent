## Logo Bar

- Same size/visual weight
- Grayscale for cleaner look

**Placement:** Immediately after hero or within hero section

## Common Mistakes

### No Product Visuals
Show the product. Screenshots beat abstract illustrations.

### Feature Overload
Highlight 3-6 key features, not every capability.

### Unclear Pricing
If pricing is shown, make it clear. No surprises.

### Weak Primary CTA
"Learn More" doesn't drive signups. Be direct.

### Missing Social Proof
No logos, testimonials, or case studies kills trust.

### No Demo/Trial Path
If you're sales-led, make it easy to request a demo.
