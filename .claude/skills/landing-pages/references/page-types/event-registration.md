## Common Mistakes

### Weak Value Proposition
"Join our webinar" doesn't convert. What will they LEARN?

### No Speaker Credibility
Why should they listen to this person? Establish expertise.

### Missing Date/Time
Date, time, and timezone must be immediately visible.

### Hidden Registration Form
Form should be visible above the fold.

### No Urgency
Limited spots, countdown, or bonuses create motivation.

### No Recording Option
Some can't attend live. "Register for the recording" captures more leads.
