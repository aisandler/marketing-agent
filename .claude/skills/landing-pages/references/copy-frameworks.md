# Copy Frameworks

Formulas and patterns for writing high-converting landing page copy.

## Headlines

The headline is the most important element. It determines whether visitors read on or leave.

### Headline Principles

**Specificity wins:** Vague headlines fail. Specific outcomes compel.
- Weak: "Improve your marketing"
- Strong: "Get 3x more leads in 30 days"

**Speak to one person:** Write for YOUR ideal customer, not everyone.

**Promise a transformation:** What will be different after they use your product?

### Headline A/B Testing

- Format (statement vs. question)
- Specificity level (exact number vs. general claim)
- Emotional tone (fear vs. aspiration)

---

## Subheadlines

The subheadline expands on the headline with supporting detail.

### Subheadline Functions

1. **Add specificity** to headline's promise
2. **Clarify the audience** (who this is for)
3. **Include a proof point** (credibility)
4. **Address an objection** proactively

### Subheadline Patterns

**How + Credibility:**
```
[How it works brief] + [trust element]
```
Example:
> "Our AI-powered platform books meetings for you while you sleep. Trusted by 500+ B2B sales teams."

**Audience + Benefit:**
```
For [specific audience] who want [outcome] without [pain]
```
Example:
> "For busy founders who want a professional website without learning to code."

**Expansion + Proof:**
```
[Expand on headline benefit]. [Proof point].
```
Example:
> "Automate your entire outreach workflow from prospect to meeting. Average ROI: 312%."

## Value Propositions

Communicate your core benefits clearly and memorably.

### 3-Pillar Framework

Present three core benefits with visual support:

```
[Icon 1]
[Benefit Title 1]
[1-2 sentence supporting detail]

[Icon 2]
[Benefit Title 2]
[1-2 sentence supporting detail]

[Icon 3]
[Benefit Title 3]
[1-2 sentence supporting detail]
```

**Title patterns:**
- Verb + Outcome: "Automate Outreach"
- Adjective + Noun: "Seamless Integration"
- Action phrase: "Launch in Minutes"

### Feature-Benefit-Proof

For each major feature:
```
[Feature]: What it does
[Benefit]: Why it matters to them
[Proof]: Evidence it works
```

Example:
> **AI Lead Scoring**
> Automatically rank leads by likelihood to convert, so you focus on prospects ready to buy.
> "Reduced time on unqualified leads by 60%" — Sarah M., VP Sales

## Calls to Action

CTAs should be clear, compelling, and action-oriented.

### CTA Principles

- Start with a **verb** (action-oriented)
- Include **benefit** when possible
- Create **ownership** ("Get YOUR...")
- Be **specific** about what happens next

### CTA Formulas

**Benefit-focused:**
```
Get [Benefit] [Timeframe]
Start [Outcome] Today
```
Examples:
- "Get Your Free Report"
- "Start Saving 10 Hours/Week"

**Action-focused:**
```
[Action] Your [Noun]
[Action] [Timeframe]
```
Examples:
- "Download Your Template"
- "Start Your 14-Day Trial"

**Joining/Community:**
```
Join [Number]+ [Audience]
Get Started [Qualifier]
```
Examples:
- "Join 5,000+ Happy Customers"
- "Get Started Free"

### CTA Variations by Goal

| Goal | Primary CTA | Alt CTA |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Lead Gen | "Get Your Free [Asset]" | "Download Now" |
| SaaS Trial | "Start Free Trial" | "Get Started Free" |
| Demo Request | "Book Your Demo" | "See It in Action" |
| Purchase | "Buy Now" | "Get [Product] Today" |
| Consultation | "Book Your Call" | "Schedule a Chat" |

### CTA Supporting Text

Add friction reducers near the button:

- "No credit card required"
- "Cancel anytime"
- "30-day money-back guarantee"
- "Takes less than 2 minutes"
- "Free forever plan available"
- "No commitment"

## Testimonials

Social proof that builds emotional connection.

### Testimonial Structure

**Full format:**
```
"[Specific result or transformation]. [How it felt/emotional benefit]. [Recommendation or endorsement]."

— [Full Name], [Role] at [Company]
[Photo]
```

Example:
> "We increased demo bookings by 40% in the first month. Finally, our sales team can focus on closing instead of chasing. I recommend this to any B2B team."
>
> — Jessica Chen, Head of Sales at TechFlow
> [Photo]

**Short format (for space constraints):**
```
"[One powerful statement about result or experience]."
— [Name], [Company]
```

### Testimonial Types

**Results-focused:**
> "We 3x'd our conversion rate in just 6 weeks."

**Transformation-focused:**
> "I went from dreading my inbox to actually enjoying work again."

**Comparison-focused:**
> "After trying 5 other tools, this is the only one that actually works."

**Objection-handling:**
> "I was skeptical at first, but the ROI paid for itself in week one."

### Testimonial Best Practices

- Use real names and photos (with permission)
- Include company/role for B2B credibility
- Feature testimonials from ideal customer profiles
- Place strategically after claims they support
- Video testimonials convert higher than text

## Problem Agitation

Make the pain vivid before presenting the solution.

### PAS Framework (Problem-Agitate-Solution)

**Problem:** Identify the pain they feel
> "You're spending hours every week on manual data entry."

**Agitate:** Make it worse, show the cost
> "That's 200+ hours a year you'll never get back. Hours you could spend closing deals, growing your team, or actually taking a vacation."

**Solution:** Present your offering as the answer
> "What if you could automate it all? [Product] handles your data entry so you can focus on what matters."

### Cost of Inaction

Quantify what they're losing by not acting:

- Time: "[X] hours per week/month"
- Money: "$[X] in lost revenue"
- Opportunity: "While you [struggle], competitors are [winning]"
- Emotion: "The stress of [problem] isn't going away"
