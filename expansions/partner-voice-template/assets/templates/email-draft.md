Email Body:

Opening Hook:
Most professionals focus on the obvious terms in an agreement. But some significant issues aren't explicitly spelled out.

Main Content:
Throughout many agreements are provisions that create obligations without specifying the details.

"If X happens, client is responsible." No specifics. No clear flag. But when X happens, suddenly your client faces unexpected obligations.

These provisions are easy to skip if you're not looking for them. That's where early review makes the difference.

Call to Action:
Have an agreement you'd like reviewed? [Use your tagline here]
