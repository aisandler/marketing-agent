# Quality / Sophistication Filter

> **TEMPLATE** - Customize this filter for your target audience's expertise level.

**The Core Principle**: Most of your target audience are experienced professionals. Content must respect that expertise.

## The Test

Before including any piece of content, ask:

> "Would an experienced {{TARGET_AUDIENCE_ROLE}} find this valuable, or would they think 'who doesn't know this?'"

If the answer is "who doesn't know this" — cut it.

## What Fails the Filter

### Obvious Advice
- "[Generic advice example 1]"
- "[Generic advice example 2]"
- "[Generic advice example 3]"
- "[Generic advice example 4]"

### Basic Explanations
- What {{BASIC_TERM_1}} is
- What goes in {{BASIC_DOCUMENT}}
- Basic terms like "{{COMMON_TERM_1}}" or "{{COMMON_TERM_2}}"
- Standard {{PROCESS}} structure

### Generic Checklists
- "Top 10 things every {{ROLE}} should know"
- "{{TOPIC}} basics"
- Basic due diligence lists everyone uses

### Condescending Framing
- "Did you know that..."
- "Many people don't realize..."
- "You might be surprised to learn..."
- "A common mistake is..."

---

## What Passes the Filter

### Hidden Complexities
- {{COMPLEXITY_EXAMPLE_1}}
- {{COMPLEXITY_EXAMPLE_2}}
- {{COMPLEXITY_EXAMPLE_3}}

### Edge Cases and Complications
- {{EDGE_CASE_1}}
- {{EDGE_CASE_2}}
- {{EDGE_CASE_3}}

### Specific, Non-Obvious Details
- {{SPECIFIC_DETAIL_1}}
- {{SPECIFIC_DETAIL_2}}
- {{SPECIFIC_DETAIL_3}}

### Expert Insights
- Why {{TOPIC}} works this way (history/context)
- How information flows (or doesn't) in real situations
- What {{STAKEHOLDER}} actually wants

### Practical, Specific Advice
- "[Specific actionable advice 1]"
- "[Specific actionable advice 2]"
- "[Specific actionable advice 3]"

## Examples: Before and After

### Example 1: {{TOPIC_1}}

**Fails Filter:**
"[Generic advice that any professional already knows]"

**Passes Filter:**
"[Specific insight with real-world example that demonstrates expertise]"

### Example 2: {{TOPIC_2}}

**Fails Filter:**
"[Basic explanation of common concept]"

**Passes Filter:**
"[Nuanced take that shows what can actually go wrong and how to prevent it]"

### Example 3: {{TOPIC_3}}

**Fails Filter:**
"[Vague statement about potential issues]"

**Passes Filter:**
"[Specific scenario with concrete details that professionals can immediately apply]"

## Applying the Filter by Format

### Email Content
- Lead with the sophisticated insight
- Skip the setup/background
- Assume they know the context
- Get to the "what you might not know" quickly

### Social Posts
- Hook with the non-obvious angle
- Don't explain what the audience already knows
- Position {{PARTNER_NAME}} as peer/expert, not teacher
- Spark "I've seen that" recognition

### Blog Articles
- Can go deeper on complexity
- Still skip the basics
- Use specific examples and scenarios
- Show expertise through nuance, not breadth

---

## When You're Unsure

If you're not sure whether something passes the filter:

1. **Ask**: "Would a {{ROLE}} with 10+ years experience already know this?"
2. **Test**: "Does this make {{PARTNER_NAME}} sound like an expert or like they're teaching a beginner class?"
3. **Check**: "Would I forward this to a colleague, or would I feel embarrassed?"

When in doubt, cut it. It's better to be too sophisticated than to risk eye-rolls from the target audience.

## The Underlying Philosophy

{{PARTNER_NAME}}'s value isn't in explaining the obvious. It's in:

1. **Catching what others miss** - Hidden issues, edge cases
2. **Knowing how things actually play out** - Real-world complications
3. **Proactive protection** - Preventing problems before they happen
4. **Relationship depth** - Understanding stakeholder dynamics

Content should demonstrate these qualities, not explain basics that any professional already knows.
