# Processing Source Material

> **TEMPLATE** - How to extract value from different types of input for partner content.

## Input Type: Call Transcripts

Call transcripts are the primary source material. Here's how to process them effectively.

### Step 1: Initial Read-Through

Read the entire transcript first without extracting anything. Note:
- What's the context? (Review call, strategy session, client meeting?)
- Who's participating?
- What's the main topic or agenda?
- What was the partner's mood/energy?

### Step 2: Insight Extraction

On second read, extract:

**Direct Quotes**
- Capture the partner's exact words when they say something memorable
- Note the context (what prompted this statement?)
- Flag quotes that could work in content

**Expert Knowledge**
- New information or corrections to previous understanding
- Specific examples or war stories
- Technical explanations in their words
- Edge cases or complications

**Topic Ideas**
- Subjects they spoke about with passion
- Areas where they corrected misconceptions
- Questions that could become content themes

**Feedback on Existing Content**
- What did they like?
- What did they want changed?
- What failed the quality filter?
- What angle adjustments did they suggest?

### Step 3: Organization

Organize extractions by:
- **Quotes** - Exact words that could be used
- **Insights** - Knowledge to inform content
- **Corrections** - Changes to previous understanding
- **Ideas** - Future content opportunities
- **Questions** - Things to follow up on

### Step 4: Flag for Follow-Up

Note anything that needs:
- Clarification from the partner
- Additional examples
- Verification of technical details
- More depth in future conversations

## Input Type: Raw Notes

When working from notes instead of transcripts:

### Check the Source
- Who wrote the notes?
- How close to the source conversation?
- Are these the partner's words or someone's interpretation?

### Verify Voice
- Notes may not capture the partner's exact phrasing
- When in doubt, mark content as "inspired by" rather than quoting
- If it doesn't sound like the partner, don't present it as their voice

### Fill Gaps
- Notes often have context gaps
- Flag anything that needs clarification
- Don't invent details that aren't there

---

## Input Type: Topic Request

When asked to create content on a specific topic:

### Check Existing Material
- Has the partner talked about this topic before?
- Are there relevant transcripts or notes?
- What quotes or insights do we already have?

### Determine Angle
- What's the partner's unique perspective on this?
- What would pass the quality filter?
- How does this connect to their core positioning?

### Flag Assumptions
- If we're inferring the partner's perspective, note that
- Mark content that needs their review/confirmation
- Don't put words in their mouth on topics they haven't addressed

## Extraction Template

Use this format when processing source material:

```markdown
## Source: [Transcript/Notes/Topic Request]
**Date:** [Date]
**Context:** [Brief description]

### Quotable Moments
1. "[Exact quote]" - Context: [what prompted this]
2. "[Exact quote]" - Context: [what prompted this]

### Key Insights
- [Insight 1]: [Explanation]
- [Insight 2]: [Explanation]

### Corrections/Updates
- [Previous understanding] → [Corrected understanding]

### Content Ideas
- [Topic]: [Suggested angle]

### Follow-Up Needed
- [Question or clarification needed]
```

## Quality Checks

Before using extracted material in content:

1. **Accuracy**: Is this exactly what the partner said/meant?
2. **Context**: Are we representing this in proper context?
3. **Voice**: Does the extracted content sound like the partner?
4. **Filter**: Does this pass the audience quality test?
5. **Positioning**: Does this align with core messages?

---

## Red Flags

Watch for these when processing source material:

**Don't Use:**
- Second-hand interpretations of the partner's views
- Quotes taken out of context
- Technical details not confirmed by the partner
- Content that conflicts with existing approved material

**Double-Check:**
- Legal/technical specifics (verify accuracy)
- Statements that could be controversial
- Anything that feels "off" from their usual voice
- Claims about company services or capabilities

---

## Referencing Source Material

When outputting content, always reference:

- **Source document**: Which transcript or notes
- **Date**: When the source was created
- **Confidence level**: How directly this comes from the partner
  - **High**: Direct quote or explicit statement
  - **Medium**: Clear implication from conversation
  - **Low**: Inference based on their general views

This helps reviewers verify and gives the partner context for what they're reviewing.
