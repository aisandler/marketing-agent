# 📊 **CONTENT OPERATIONS**

## Content Pipeline

```
LOCAL (this project)                    AIRTABLE (external-visible)
┌─────────────────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────────────┐
│ content/social/content-bank.md       │ Content Calendar          │
│ ├── Raw themes from calls   │   →    │ ├── Scheduled posts only │
│ ├── Partner voice profiles  │        │ ├── Approved copy        │
│ └── Usage tracking (IDs)    │        │ └── Status workflow      │
└─────────────────────────────┘         └──────────────────────────┘
```

**Key principle:** Keep content development local. Airtable only shows scheduled/active posts.

This repository is a brand-agnostic template. To configure for your brand:

1. Place brand materials in `onboarding/intake/`
2. Run `/onboard` to generate your brand architecture
3. The system creates brand-specific files in `client-context/`
4. Configure `.claude/settings.local.json` with your welcome message (see `CLAUDE.template.md`)

**Brand-specific files (generated by /onboard):**
- `client-context/brand/` - Brand architecture, voice guides
- `client-context/business/` - Business information
- `client-context/competitors/` - Competitive analysis
- `client-context/keywords/` - SEO keywords
- `content/social/` - Social content bank
- `content/email/` - Email content
- `.claude/memory/` - Session memory
